## About

This project is intended to be educational, for-research only as it solves a fictional problem. It is not intended to work on any production environment whatsoever, but if you ever come across a need to use it, just be careful, as it can potentially leak sensitive/privileged data due to its most basic functionality.

I use this project to keep myself updated in the programming languages I use the most, as I try to keep all the implementations current.
